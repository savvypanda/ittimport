Add ability to set a return URL instead of just going back to invoices listing
This function replaces the original save function:
NEW

    function save($apply = false)
    {
		
		//hack IIT Books modified to return to page of choice by sending page
		if (empty(JRequest::getCmd('return'))) :
			$redirect = 'index.php?option=com_vminvoice&controller=invoices&task=editOrder&cid=' . $id;
		else:
			$redirect = base64_decode(JRequest::getCmd('return'));
		endif;
		
		
        $model = $this->getModel('order');
        /* @var $model VMInvoiceModelOrder */
        $id = $model->save(JRequest::get('post',4)); //4 = allow HTML
        if ($apply)
            $this->setRedirect($redirect, JText::_('COM_VMINVOICE_ORDER_SAVED'));
        else
            $this->cancel('Order saved');
    }	
ORIGINAL

/administrator/components/com_vminvoice/helpers/getter.php
Completely refactored (simplified) getAjaxUserList function to fix a major performance problem on the site. If we ever upgrade VMInvoice, this will have to be gutted again.


/administrator/components/com_vminvoice/models/invoices.php
Removed the join to the #__vminvoice_mailsended table from the query, and all related field mentions
Also added a condition to where clause to use the index on virtuemart_vendor_id to speed up the query:
	$where[] = 'o.virtuemart_vendor_id="1"';


/administrator/components/com_vminvoice/models/order.php
Added code to update the order status on every edit
